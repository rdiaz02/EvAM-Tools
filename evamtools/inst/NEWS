	- HyperTraPS: predicted genotype frequencies now
	  available after updates upstream.

Changes in version 3.3.1 (2025-05-08):
	- HyperTraPS changes:
	  - We cannot produce, for now, predicted genotype frequencies.
	  - Created custom plots based on HyperTraPS's ones.

Changes in version 3.2.1 (2025-05-03):
	- Many additions/modifications to HyperTraPS-CT plotting,
	  default arguments, input of arguments via Shiny app,

	  with more than one parent).

Changes in version 2.1.21 (2025-03-21):
	- Allow using ct-cbn: really do use ct-cbn as starting
	  (version 2.1.18, though following my understanding
	  of the help of h-cbn, was not).
	- Added comments to CBN code.

Changes in version 2.1.20 (2025-03-18):
	- Bug fix: MCCBN td_trans_mat was actually that from CBN
	  (and, I guess, would have returned an error if only
	  MCCBN had been run).

	  landing page.

Changes in version 2.1.12 (2022-09-22):
	- Renamed argument to H-ESBCN that controls number

	  In both package and web app.

Changes in version 2.1.11 (2022-09-21):
	- Minimize possible errors with histograms in shiny app
	  with very long genotype names. If error, provide

	  additional figure and improved previous figure.
	- More details about csv upload, including examples, and all
	  now in a Help button.
	- Improved use of left column space.

Changes in version 2.1.9 (2022-09-07):
	- Changed landing page to include better explanations of use
	  of web app, including the figure with the overview.
	- Changes in web app for consistent naming of terms.

Changes in version 2.1.8 (2022-08-09):
	- More changes to the web app:
	- Much better error messages when manipulating DAGs.
	- The DAG model is part of the data.
	- Can remove edges by setting them to 0.
	- Additional checks of internal consistency
	  during/after DAG manipulation.
	- Code cleanup.
	- (An version 2.1.7? well, this sums up both)

Changes in version 2.1.6 (2022-08-08):
	- More changes to the web app:
	- More intuitive behavior of the modal box for changing
	  gene names.
	- Code cleaned and better commented.
	- numericInput for sampling arguments: do not go up to 1.

Changes in version 2.1.5 (2022-08-07):
	- Web-app mainly; many changes. Most relevant listed:
	- Much better documentation
	- Better and clearer catching of user errors during DAG
	  creation and changes,
	- Using RDS/rds extension consistently.
	- Do not reset noise and number of samples to default
	  (respect user settings).
	- More strict checking of gene and file names provided
	  by users.
	- Better default examples that allow more comfortable
	  playing with the interface (no lambdas > 1, so they
	  can be turned to OncoBN and OT).
	- Histograms of predicted genotype freqs: show only
	  20 most abundant ones.

Changes in version 2.1.4 (2022-08-05):
	- Web-app: can provide gene names. Not the same as
	  changing them, but it provides the important
	  functionality (build models with arbitrarily
	  named genes).
	- Web-app: igraph: we use try, for the occasional error
	  of igraph not displaying the plot.
	- Web-app: more documentation in better tooltips.

Changes in version 2.1.3 (2022-08-04):
	- Web-app: no changing gene names. Was confusing and
	  error and bug prone.
	- Several weird and hard to reproduce bugs when using
	  Create data interactively with non-consecutive gene names
	  and changing name of data.
	- Better output of table of genotype frequencies.

Changes in version 2.1.2 (2022-08-03):
	- Always ensure that table of genotype counts in standard
	  order.
	- The former fixes strange bugs when changing genotype counts
	  in some DAGs and with weirdly ordered manually entered data.
	- Methods to show graphical output: only those used for analyses.
	- Miscell improvements of the look of the "Results" tab (moved
	  help text to tooltips, etc).

Changes in version 2.1.1 (2022-08-03):
	- Input now clearly differentiates creating DAG/MHN from
	  generating data from them.
	- More consistent help and miscell typos fixed.
	- Return gracefully instead of giving errors when renaming
	  not yet loaded data sets.
	- Cleaner, more elegant handling of not-yet-created data.
	- Code clean up.

	- Most of the changes affect the web app.
	- Clearer, cleaner interface for input.
	- Clearer, cleaner output, with table and plots synced.
	- igraph output resizes now.
	- Better use of the output screen real state as a function of models
	  being displayed.
	- Genotype frequency can be modified for all types of input (upload,
	  and generated from models ---DAGs, MHN).
	- Data sets wiht only WT can be created and dealt with (not analzed,
	  though, as that would make no sense).
	- Fixed many occasional bugs: renaming genes, renaming data sets,
	  changing genotype counts.
	- Improved help and some tooltips.

Changes in version 1.1.7 (2022-07-06):
	- Additional error check for gene name changes.

	- User provides dataset name for uploaded data.
	- Avoid identical names in DAG and cross-sectional examples.
	- Better handling of repeated and empty user inputed dataset names.
	- Do not draw DAG on rename of genes in cross-sectional data.

Changes in version 1.1.5 (2022-07-04):
	- MHN matrix figure: can handle just fine gene names up to seven letters.
	- Better formating of small edge probs/lambdas (e.g., 2.998111e-3).
	- Clarified top_paths = NULL possible problems with many genes.

Changes in version 1.1.4 (2022-05-03):
	- Shiny web app: consistent behavior when changing number of genes for DAGs and MHN.
